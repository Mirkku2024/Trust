## Summary from Cyber kill chain
Traditional way of defensing network isn't enough anymore. With kill chain model you can gain better understanding of threats. This mitigates risks and vulnerabilities when hackers are targeting your company. There are 7 different phases in kill chain: reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, C2 and actions. You must analyze all attacks and build defense towards them so they wouldn't happen in the future. Also with the knowledge of failed intrusions you can guess attackers next attempt and defend your network against those.

## Summary from Darknet diaries Episode 127 Maddie
Maddie Stone is a security researcher for Google’s Project Zero. In this episode we hear what it’s like battling zero day vulnerabilities. Her career started there as working as a reverse-engineer trying to detect malwares from Android code and telling developers how to solve them. One case named Chamoi was a bottnet using very sofisticated native library in an app on android devices. This case took over a year to be solved out. That case lead Maddie to start working on Project Zero. Project Zero team tries to find unknown malwares and Maddie's knowledge brought a new aspect to this work as finding patterns between unknown malwares. Maddie has gained a lot of respect due to her work but also personal threats for being a target for large criminal organizations and even nation's army. Maddie thinks that the work Project Zero does makes it lots harder for hackers to create new types of malware.
