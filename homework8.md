## Homework 8
Voluntary bonus. List and link

a) Improved. Any tasks that you have considerably improved after cross review 

At first I struggled a lot with installing Debian on Linux Virtualbox. By the time of third homework I managed finally and could crack hashcat code https://github.com/Mirkku2024/Trust/blob/main/homework3.md

Then I explored next issues with keyboard settings but I managed to solve those too and got my finnish keyboard in Linux. I also made some mistakes when putting all homeworks on the same file but managed to report my homeworks separately since the third one.
